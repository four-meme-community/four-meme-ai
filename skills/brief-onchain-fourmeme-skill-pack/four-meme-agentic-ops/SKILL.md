# Four.Meme Agentic Ops

## Usage

- Category: Ecosystem
- Mode: guide
- Version: 0.1.0

## Input Example

```json
{
  "goal": "momentum_entry",
  "riskTier": "medium",
  "maxCapitalBnb": 0.6,
  "entrySlices": 3,
  "confirmationMode": "human_in_the_loop"
}
```

## Operating Loop

1. Discover candidates (read-only):
   ```bash
   npx fourmeme token-list
   npx fourmeme token-rankings
   ```
2. Score each candidate with a fixed rubric:
   - liquidity quality
   - price acceleration
   - holder concentration
   - tax and transfer constraints
3. Build a proposed execution plan (size, slices, and invalidation).
4. Ask for explicit confirmation on every write action.
5. Execute using trade commands from the approved plan:
   ```bash
   npx fourmeme quote-buy ...
   npx fourmeme buy ...
   npx fourmeme quote-sell ...
   npx fourmeme sell ...
   ```
6. Monitor and journal:
   ```bash
   npx fourmeme events <fromBlock> [toBlock]
   ```
   Record rationale, execution hash, and post-trade outcome.

## Agentic Policy

- Keep default mode as assistive, not autonomous.
- Require explicit user confirmation for all on-chain writes.
- Apply hard risk caps before each order (`maxCapitalBnb`, `maxLossBnb`, `maxSlippageBps`).
- Re-check wallet and quote right before execution to avoid stale state.
